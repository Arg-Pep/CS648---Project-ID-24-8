# CS648---Project-ID-24-8: Exploring the geography of GIS-related publishing over the past decade
Journal publishing is a milestone in scientific research, crucial for divulging knowledge and measuring the reputation of academic institutions and scientists. Experts in the GIScience community believe that shifts in journal publishing have occurred in recent years, such as the emergence of China as the leading country in publication quantity. This study aims to provide further insights into these intuitions and analyse publication trends in Europe, author collaboration in journal publishing and research topic trends using a data-driven approach. Data from 12,993 research articles published between 2013 and 2023 from ten of the most reputable GIScience journals is analysed to address the research questions. This research is particularly significant as it intends to close the research gap caused by the scarcity of quantitative analyses of publications metrics in GIScience, which is essential for the research community to understand the disciplineâ€™s evolution and tendencies.
